# Human Force Modeling for Admittance Control in Human-Robot Collaboration - xArm7
Model System: Admittance Control (Mass-Damper System)
Proposed: A human force modeling method to dynamically update admittance control parameters of a robotic arm using system identification and gradient descent
Previous: Variable Admittance Control using AdaDelta, steepest descent, etc.
Codes are temporary written and not well-organazed.

# Posstural Control System of a Twin Cycle
Development, implementation, testing of a postural control system for a twin cycle
